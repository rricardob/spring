### Railway

Bring your code, we'll handle the rest. Made for any language, for projects big and small. [Railway](https://railway.app/)
is the cloud that takes the complexity out of shipping software.

Create a new empty project in Railway and start by creating a PostgreSQL database. Once you have that created you can create
a new project from GitHub. You can use the following environment variables based on the database you just created.

```properties
PROD_DB_HOST=monorail.proxy.rlwy.net
PROD_DB_PORT=55053
PROD_DB_NAME=railway
PROD_DB_PASSWORD=4DDegac1e4EHeHAFEcaDfA2GhhAcfCgd
PROD_DB_USERNAME=root
```
